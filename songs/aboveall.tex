\begin{song}{Above all}
%tonart{A}
{\bf 1.} [A/Cis|]{Above} all [D]powers, [E]above all [A]kings,
[A/Cis|]{above} all [D]nature and [E]all created [A]things. [E/Gis|]{\quad}
Above all [fis]wisdom and [fis/E]all the ways of [D]man, [A/Cis|]{\quad}
[h]You were here be[h/A]fore the world be[E/Gis|]{gan.}

{\bf 2.} [A/Cis|]{Above} all [D]kingdoms, [E]above all [A]thrones,
[A/Cis|]{above} all [D]wonders this [E]world has ever [A]known.  [E/Gis|]{\quad}
Above all [fis]wealth and [fis/E]treasures of the [D]earth, [A/Cis|]{\quad}
[h]There's no way to[h/A] measure what you're [Cis\h7]worth.

\begin{chorus}
[A]Cruci[h]fied, [E]laid behind the [A]stone,
You [A]lived and [h]died, re[E]jected and a[A]lone.
Like a [fis|]{rose,} [fis/E]trampled on the [D]ground,  [A/Cis|]{\quad}
You took the [h]fall, and thought of [D]me, [E]above [A]all.   
\end{chorus}
